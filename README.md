# Rummikub XL - Custom Board Inlay

This repository contains a custom 3D-printable board inlay designed specifically for Rummikub XL.

This project aims to fundamentally speed up the setup and teardown of each round. Instead of scattering unused tiles face-down on the table - which creates clutter - this system allows you to store them in dedicated, lidded holders. This keeps the game organized, speeds up drawing tiles, and prevents opponents from seeing the tiles.

### 📂 Components
* **2x Holder:** 4 cm of depth, used to store the card holders.

* **1x Holder lid**

* **1x Lid Knob**

### 📏 Dimensions

### ⚙️ Print settings

* **Supports:** Only needed for the holder lid, only minimal supports are needed.

* For build plate adhesion, we recommend to use Brim to prevent corners from warping.
